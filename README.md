# 3-tier-Architecture-using-Docker


One common architecture for information systems that includes a user interface and persistent storage of data is known as the three-tier architecture. A classic description of the vertical tiers is:
Presentation - windows, reports, and so on.
Application Logic - tasks and rules which govern the process.
Storage - persistent storage mechanism.
The singular quality of a three-tier architecture is the separation of the application logic into a distinct logical middle tier of software. The presentation tier is relatively free of application processing; windows forward task requests to the middle tier. The middle tier communicates with the back-end storage layer.
